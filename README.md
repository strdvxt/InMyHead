# InMyHead
I try to make my diary through this github account

Hello, today is  7 June 2024
I create this as a diary or anything what inside my head. Now its 1.26 AM and I think it would be great if I put it on my github account.
 well yes it only a readme.md
 There is a lot of things happen in my head now.
Everytime i had been on my way home from my university, i always thinking about anything happen in a day. But currently now i had really busy busy day because of, preparation of KRI, ESC lab thing, P2MW mentoring, my 5 tubes in this semesters, my project about BUDIKDAMBER, and many more that i cant remember. my chess running so bad now bcs i have eat my last and first meal for yesterday and today. I was accompany Î± to get through of his day. I learn about how people come and go is can hurt people so bad. how human's feelings can easily affect eveything.
  i also think about, being in beetween. between you are a left head engineer and the right head of social people. and i cant make it turn to a puzzle. its like we did the same thing. when i did a mentoring with pak hergum i was thingking about how we can sell a food for a 'market'. then i see a supermarket. people going to supermarket because they need to and there is so many reason and parameters that supermarket can reach the people. as a seller we fine a good product rationally and we need to find a market irrationally. so do an engineer, we install the motor to a thing and we have to find a right mounting so it can installed nicely. oh no im tired bye(1.43)
